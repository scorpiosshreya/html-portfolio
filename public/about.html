<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>As a college senior in the University of San Francisco pursuing a major in finance with a minor in computer science, my academic journey has been fueled by a dual passion for both fields. Throughout my undergraduate years, I have eagerly immersed myself in the world of finance, driven by a fascination for the intricacies of financial markets, investment strategies, and the ever-evolving global economy. Concurrently, my exploration of computer science has allowed me to embrace the power of technology as a catalyst for innovation in the financial sector. This unique combination of disciplines has not only broadened my horizons but also ignited a deep-seated enthusiasm for leveraging computational tools and algorithms to unlock new opportunities in the financial landscape. With each passing day, my commitment to mastering the dynamic interplay between finance and computer science grows stronger, propelling me towards a future where I can make meaningful contributions at the intersection of these two domains.</p>
