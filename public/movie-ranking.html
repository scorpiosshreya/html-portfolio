<h1>The Best Movies According to Shreya</h1>
<h2>My top 3 movies of all time.</h2>
<hr />
<h3> The Circle</h3>
<p>I must have seen a different film to the majority who have commented. It is an extremely interesting and thought provoking film about technology which is almost with us now. There are of course some who would like to move in that direction but we are shown the negatives as well as the positives and the negatives far outweigh the positives. If you wear a 'fit bit' or some similar device you can get an e Mail, unsolicited, telling you your battery is low! Your mobile phone knows your exact location at any time. Don't dismiss this film as lightweight, imo it is not. As for the ending we don't want all films to leave nothing to our own imaginations. Emma Watson imo was excellent and Tom Hanks portrayed a character who was very believable.</p>
<h3>The Princess Protection Program</h3>
<p>Me personally I loved it. I watched this movie so long ago and watching it today is even better. I never really knew that Disney channel movies can shine that bright. Even better my two inspirations where in it. Now this was some pretty good acting skills. But there where moments that didn't feel real but most of those moments felt pretty real. It would also be great if there was a number two of that movie.  Every time I watch it, it makes me feel warm in the inside. From all of the parts she felt sad to all of the parts she felt happy. I feel like I could watch that movie every day and it would never get old. It's been 11 years and that movie is still Balling  just like high school musical. I never felt so into a movie before but that movie has me so interested. I don't even want to get up which is why I am giving this movie 5 stars.</p>
<h3>What's New Scooby Doo</h3>
<p>After Disney's 1 Saturday Morning and FOX Kids were canceled by their respective networks, I was searching for a new show to watch on Sat. Mornings. I soon heard that a new Scooby-Doo show was going into production for the now-defunct WB network. Zoinks! Remembering that I have been a SD fan since I was a toddler, I was excited and watched every episode when it initially aired, and watched the reruns. While many say that this is a bad remake, I disagree. What's New, Scooby-Doo? is INDEED a VERY entertaining show, and not a bad remake. The writing is LOL funny, the animation is stunning, and a HUGE improvement over the original show's animation, as well as the casting, Casey Kasem reprises his role as Shaggy, Frank Welker not only reprises his role as Fred, but now voices Scooby, too! As for the girls, well, Grey DeLisle (DUH-lyle) voices Daphne and Mindy Cohn (Natalie Green from the Facts of Life) voices Velma. I own all 3 seasons of the show on DVD so I can watch them anytime I want, and I still watch the reruns from time to time on Cartoon Network. If you and your family like Scooby-Doo, check out this show. You won't be sorry.</p>
